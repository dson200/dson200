Hello, I'm David

BRIEF INTRODUCTION

I am an entry-level cybersecurity professional who recently started the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program. I am very excited to delve into the cybersecurity world and aim to gain a complete understanding and proficiency with SIEM, alert triage, Linux operating systems, and SQL.


OBJECTIVE

My main goal is to complete the Google Career Certificate training and a couple of CompTIA courses within the next 6 months to become a Cybersecurity Analyst. After completing the programs, I believe I can demonstrate hands-on experience with the Linux command line, identifying common risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as techniques to mitigate them. Additionally, I aim to safeguard networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

I've been in the Automotive Retail business for the last 28 years and have experienced many incidents where dealers' and customers' sensitive information was easily accessible to anyone in the showroom. I understand how critical this issue is. I am eager to leverage my knowledge and training to mitigate and protect companies and people.
